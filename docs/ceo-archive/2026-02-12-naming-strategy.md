# Naming Strategy (2026-02-12)

## Company: "Aethris" — APPROVED
- Invented word, zero SEO competition
- Sounds premium/mythological, fits dark/premium aesthetic
- Investor-friendly, works for platform play
- Pronunciation: "AY-thris"
- Action: Check aethris.com, aethris.ai availability. Quick USPTO trademark search.

## Character: "Mona" — KEEP FOR LAUNCH, review at 50 users
- Short, easy, reads as a person
- Weaknesses: Genshin Impact overlap, crowded SEO, common name
- Switching cost is low now (~47 files, find-and-replace)
- At 50 users, ask: "What do you think of the name?"

## Company vs Character names: SEPARATE (industry standard)
- Landing page: "Mona" everywhere (user-facing)
- Footer: "Copyright Aethris"
- Legal entity: Aethris LLC
- Domain: product domain (mona-related) primary, aethris.com secondary

## If renaming later:
- 4-6 letters, sounds like a person
- No collision with major anime/game characters
- Available as .ai or .com
- Slightly exotic/invented, anime-native
