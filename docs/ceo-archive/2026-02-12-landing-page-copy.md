# Landing Page Copy Overhaul (2026-02-12)

## IMPLEMENTED — All recommendations applied to page.tsx

### Hero Subtext (Option A selected):
> "She'll roast your music taste, remember your dog's name, and text you at 2am asking why you're still awake. Not your typical chatbot."

### Feature Section Subtext:
> "She has opinions, a sense of humor, and zero patience for boring conversation."

### Feature Cards:
1. "Tell her your cat's name once. She'll ask how Mr. Whiskers is doing three weeks later."
2. "She doesn't just type — she talks. And you can hear when she's teasing you versus when she actually means it."
3. "Day one she's curious. Week two she's stealing your hoodies. The relationship actually goes somewhere."
