# Long-Term Strategy Discussion (2026-02-12)

## Key Strategic Questions (Resolved)

1. **Product vs Technology company** — Start as product company, build toward technology optionality.
   - Phase 0-2 (months 0-8): Pure product. Ship Mona, get users, get paying subscribers.
   - Phase 2-3 (months 8-14): Extract emotional AI systems into clean modules with clear APIs.
   - Phase 3 decision point (months 14-18): Choose path based on data.
   - Key insight: A successful consumer product with strong retention IS the proof that the emotional AI infrastructure works.

2. **First 100 users** — Target r/CharacterAI first.
   - 2.5M members, top 1% subreddit. Users actively frustrated with memory issues.
   - Viral hook: 30-second screen recording showing Mona remembering details, reacting emotionally, speaking naturally.
   - Framing: "I built an AI companion that actually remembers you."
   - Offer free access to first 50 users who DM. Talk to every one.
   - Deadline: 50 users within 2 weeks of deploy.

3. **Unfair advantage** — Accumulated emotional data as primary moat.
   - After 30 days, a user's Mona is fundamentally different from a new user's Mona.
   - Pitch: "Our moat is accumulated emotional data. Every day a user talks to Mona, their experience gets more personalized through memory, affection, and relationship progression in ways that cannot be ported to a competitor."

## Strategic Decisions

- **DO NOT build retention features before launch.** Retention is a problem for when users exist and leave.
- **DO NOT build streaks.** Wrong mechanic for relationship products.
- **DEFER currency/Petals economy** until 1000+ paying subscribers
- **DEFER seasonal events** until meaningful user base exists
- **DEFER Relationship Milestones** until 5-10 users return for a second session
- **Relationship Milestones spec is APPROVED** — build when timing is right

## Approved 18-Month Roadmap

- **Phase 0 (2-4 weeks):** Launch readiness
- **Phase 1 (months 1-3):** Find PMF — 500 active users, 30%+ D7 retention
- **Phase 2 (months 3-8):** Monetization — subscription ($7.99/mo), target $5K MRR
- **Phase 3 (months 8-18):** Scale — decide product vs platform based on data

## NSFW Content Decision

- Permissive by default on web. Do NOT make it the brand identity.
- SFW toggle available. Do not gatekeep.
- Web-only distribution avoids app store gatekeeping.

## Emotional AI Infrastructure Market

- **Hume AI**: $80M funding, Google acqui-hired CEO + 7 engineers (Jan 2026). EVI, Octave TTS.
- **Gradium**: $70M seed from FirstMark/Eurazeo. TTS/STT APIs.
- We are NOT competing with them. They are potential suppliers. Our differentiation is "relationship persistence."

## AI Companion Market Data

- $120M+ revenue in 2025, 64% YoY growth, 337 active apps, 220M downloads.
- Revenue per download: $1.18 (up from $0.52 in 2024).
- Top 10% capture 89% of revenue. Differentiation matters more than being early.

## Product Philosophy (Red Lines)

- Never gate emotional content behind paywalls
- Never use streak anxiety or loss aversion
- Never create artificial scarcity on interactions
- Monetize convenience and customization, not the relationship itself

## Competitive Weaknesses We Exploit

- **Character.AI**: Memory is their #1 complaint. Our memory system directly solves this.
- **Replika**: Users angry about ERP removal and paywalled emotional features.
- **Both**: Want better voice, better visuals, less repetition.
