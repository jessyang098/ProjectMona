# Streamer Companions Idea (2026-02-12)

## DECIDED: Not now. Revisit at Phase 2.

## 5-Filter Test: 1.5 / 5 — DOES NOT PASS

| Filter | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| User Value | MIXED | Real value but different use case than companion |
| Retention Impact | LOW | Does not improve companion retention |
| Moat Contribution | LOW | Public entertainer has no switching cost |
| Monetization | PARTIAL | $4-25/mo SaaS but lower LTV |
| Strategic Fit | LOW | Different market, different competition |

## Competition is already crowded:
- Neuro-sama (dominant, ~$2-2.5M ARR)
- ai_licia ($3.99-$24.99/mo, shipping)
- Questie AI ($10-$25/mo, shipping)
- Streamlabs ISA (incumbent)
- Shizuku AI (a16z-backed)

## Conditions to Revisit (ALL must be true):
1. 200+ active companion users
2. D7 retention >25%
3. At least 3 conversations with actual streamers expressing interest
4. Companion revenue covering operating costs

## If conditions met: 2-week experiment with 3-5 small streamers.
